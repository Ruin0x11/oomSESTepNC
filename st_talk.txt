Welcome to Vernis!
The mines around Vernis have brought a lot of money into our small community.  We are thriving thanks to the mines!
Vernis may just be a coal mining town, but we have a long and notable history.
If I were you, I wouldn't dare play the piano in the bar while Loyter is hanging out in there.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
We're caught in the crossfire of the war between the Yerles and the Eulderna for some time now.
Rumor has it that something of great value has been found in Lesimas.
It seems there is a way to obtain new skills. See the trainer to the east of the town center.
Be careful about carrying too much stuff.  You should sell off anything you don't actually need.
That weirdo near the graveyard? Don't pay any attention to that bum. He's a hopeless junkie and I'm pretty sure he's an alcoholic too.
Miches is nuts about stuffed animals.  She's completely obsessed with collecting them.
The road to the east leads to the capital city of Palmia.
You could bounce a quarter off of Shena's ass.  How does she stay in such great shape?
We've had a lot of trouble with thieves recently.
The people in that live in the Cyber Dome are so strange.  What a bunch of freaks!
Vernis is the only known source of coal in the entirety of North Tyris.  We're making a killing.
You're going to Palmia?  Just follow the road to the east.
Everyone loves Shena's ass.

アセリア海への玄関口、トーマットへようこそ。

ザナンのおかげでこの街は潤っている{のだ}。
メイルーンへの運航が予定されているというのは本当{かな}。
ジューアはジューア同士の争いで忙しいの{だ}。
ザナンの人間は堅物だと聞いていた{が}、この街では羽目を外しているの{かな}。

Ah, there's nothing like the salty smell of the sea breeze.
I love to watch the brutal fights in the pet arena.  You have to be careful though, sometimes audience members catch a stray bullet or get hit by careless dragons.  But you know, the risk is part of the thrill.
Raphael is the enemy of all women.
If you want the best training a fighter can have, you should check out the fighter's guild under the arena office.
The price of seafood cargo is very high farther inland. 
I wonder how you get into that Pyramid north of town.  I have heard of people trying to go there, but none of them ever come back.
I hear that a lot of the seediest and creepiest people head to Derphy.  I'm not sure where that place is, but we seem to get more than our fair share of thieves and vagabonds, so maybe it's not that far from here.

This village is called Yowyn. 
The horses sold here are the finest in the land.
We always seem to be short-handed during the harvest season.  I'm sure everyone in town would be glad to have you lend a hand.
Sometimes we see known outlaws heading to the west after they raid our farms or kill our cattle.  I wonder if something is out there.
Head east out of town, and follow the road north to reach the capital of the Kingdom of Palmia.  Be careful around that old fortress though, it's a strange place.  I've heard sometimes people that go near that place are gunned down by ancient machines that survived from Eyth Terre.
The elder always talks about an old run down castle to the southwest.  That old bag is always making up crazy stories.
Yowyn's economy is pretty small, but we do make excellent caskets.  Sometimes the nobles from Palmia send their squires and servants down here to buy them.
The air is so fresh and lively here in the countryside.  I wouldn't give this up for anything.%END

Welcome to Derphy, a rotten hive of scum and villainy.
Noel is crazy.  She'd bite the head off of a kitten if she had the chance.  She kills things and spreads chaos for the hell of it.  I don't mind a thief, but she's a bit over the top.
A lot of thieves hang out here.  They have a hideout under the casino but they won't just let you in.
Slavery is a very lucrative business.  Many people claim it's evil, but even mighty Palmia's economy would disintegrate if they didn't have any slaves to work their fields.
Nothing beats a bloody match at the arena.  If you want to impress the crowd then give them lots of drama and blood.
Derphy has no city guards, so we can do whatever we want!

Palmia is huge.  I got lost in this town all the time.  It's really hard to find other people sometimes.
I wonder what's wrong with Mia, she's so weird.  I wish she'd just learn how to talk properly, that'd help a lot.
I can't make out anything that Mia says.
Welcome to the capital of Palmia!  Our kingdom is old and very prosperous.
King Xabi and Queen Stersha are a beautiful couple.
One of our special products here are toys that the nobility often buy for their children.  There are machines in the center of town that sell them, if you can get some coins maybe you can get some awesome toys out of them too.
The etherwinds have been getting strong and more dangerous over the last fifty years.  My grandfather always tells me about how weak they used to be.  If they grow much stronger we might be forced to abandon our homes.
My friend told me there is an ancient fortress to the north.  I wonder if that's true.
We have a lot of parties in Palmia.  The nobility will throw money at any excuse for a drunken celebration.

I want to drink crim ale to death!
What's an another name for a hare's tail?
King Xabi is a wise man.  At least, that's what I've heard.
Sometimes I drink crim ale until I pass out.
Cats... why are they so cute?
Yerles is a new kingdom that has recently risen to prominence.
Eulderna was the first country to explore and research the ruins of Nefia.
I wonder if the shopkeepers really are invincible...
Apparently, there is a way to learn the location of artifacts after all.
Hungry sea lions love to eat fish.
Sleep and rest well when you are sick! My grandma told me the blessed healing potion also works.

Money makes the world go round.  I wonder where I can get some more money.
Money and currency are critical to our society. 
Do you have any good ideas for investments?
I'm very much into economics. 
Platinum coins are a lot rarer than gold.  Spend them wisely. 
Eulderna always suffers from huge deficits, but it never really seems to slow them down.  They can't just invent money like that forever.
Zanan's postwar system is a monarchy, but internally the country still operates on the outdated systems used during Eyth Terre.

Sierre Terre is the 11th era on Irva.
Are you on drugs? Irva is our world, of course.
The land of North Tyris has countless ruins and dungeons on it.  They are part of a long lost civilization called Nefia.
Science in the eighth era of Eyth Terre was far more advanced than ours.
In Eyth Terre, magic and science were thought to be opposites.
I like talking about science. 
Vernis is the biggest coal-mining town in North Tyris.
Lumiest is the famous city of art.

You should never leave home without an ample supply of food.  Starving to death would be a pretty abysmal fate.
Eternal League...? I've never heard of that. 
Sierre Terre is the 11th era.
I like travelling.  I've been to so many places.
If you find adventuring too difficult by yourself, go to Derphy and buy a few slaves to watch your back.
Don't drop items in your shop that you want to keep. They will probably be sold!
You can safely store items in buildings that you own.
If you drop items in a town, the janitors will probably dump them.
Guards will attack you if your karma drops too low.  At least *try* to keep a low profile.
If your pets and allies fall in combat, bartenders in town can bring them back.
Be sure to give good equipment to your allies and pets, since it will make them more effective in battle.
Potions that reverse the effects of the etherwind exist, but they are rare and quite valuable.
If you're planning to buy a building, start with a museum. The maintenance cost is cheap and they start making a profit quickly.
One of your best sources of income and fame is the arena.
If you are having hard time traveling, maybe you should purposely lower your fame.
Gamble chests are good for practicing lock picking.
